Hello World!
After several attempts to create awful and useless personal websites, I've decided to do things properly.

I've added a blog, where I will focus mainly on Linux-related topics, FOSS software and privacy.
I've just pre-ordered a Pinephone, so expect some tutorials about it.

To enlarge the audience, I've decided to make this English version of my website. I apologize for any errors, but I'm Italian and I'm still learning.

If you have any comments or suggestions you can write me by email, in the next days I will add a comment section.

New articles will arrive soon, so stay tuned ðŸ˜„
